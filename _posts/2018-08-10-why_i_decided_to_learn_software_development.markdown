When I was young, I would hear the term Software Development and I wouldn't really be interested. However, as I got older I started to understand what it meant to be a Software Developer. Learning different languages, speaking to computer, and trying to create something got me intrigued. It got me into the field of understanding computers. At first it wasn't even about coding, I started just trying to understand everything about a computer, from building one to understanding every commands and instruction I can use. Then when I heard about Software Development, it got me interested. I started to learn code in College, but it was difficult to keep up due to constent working and not being able to give time to just code but my love for coding did start my last full semester of college. It was for my C++ class my final project, I wanted to give my all and try to use everything I learned into that project. I created a program that tested people on their math skills. Most of the programming was difficult but once I completed it and it was working that was the best feeling I had. Thats when I decided to follow my path to learning Software Development.
